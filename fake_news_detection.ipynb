      "('Germany approves sale of three Thyssenkrupp submarines to Israel', 'BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government has approved the sale of three Thyssenkrupp submarines to Israel and will provide financial support for the purchase, government spokesman Steffen Seibert told a regular news conference on Monday. The estimated $2 billion deal is under police investigation  in Israel over suspected corruption and several public officials and private citizens have been questioned in the case. The 2016 deal has been under public scrutiny since it emerged that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s personal lawyer also represented Thyssenkrup Marine System s local agent, raising concerns of a conflict of interest. The attorney has denied wrongdoing and said he never discussed the deal with Netanyahu. Israel s justice ministry said in February that Netanyahu himself was not a suspect. Addressing Israel s parliament, Netanyahu told opposition lawmakers that the new deal with Germany helped vindicate him.   How sad for you, that you have been staking your hopes on recycling the submarines story, but also understand that this story, too, has been sunk,  he said.  Seibert said Germany would make a contribution of up to 540 million euros to help finance Israel s purchase. Seibert said an inter-governmental memorandum of understanding approving the deal would be signed later on Monday.  I would like to thank (German) Chancellor (Angela) Merkel and her government for this memorandum, which touches on a matter that is very important for Israel s national security,  Netanyahu said in his speech.

      "(' Another White Guy Goes On A Shooting Spree And Officials Refuse To Call It Terrorism (VIDEO)', 'Six people are dead after a white, domestic terrorist went on a shooting spree in Kalamazoo, Michigan on Saturday, and officials are refusing to call it terrorism.Jason Brian Dalton, 45, started his shooting spree at an apartment complex where he shot a woman multiple times while her three children watched. The woman is in critical condition but expected to survive. Four hours later, Dalton killed a father and son who were car shopping at a Kia dealership. Less than a half hour later he began chatting with people in two cars at a Cracker Barrel restaurant when he suddenly began shooting, killing four women and injuring a 14-year-old girl.At 1 a.m. Sunday, police pulled over a navy blue Chevy HHR and arrested Dalton without incident. Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety said that he was  even-tempered  when police stopped him: Suspect is Jason Dalton, dob June 22, 1970, no known criminal record. His demeanor was even-tempered upon arrest according to the prosecutor. He was cooperative. Acts committed were intentional. Semi-auto handgun was found in suspect vehicle. Video at businesses led to suspect vehicle description. No other crime scenes we are aware of. Prosecutor Jeff Getting said that Dalton acted alone and this was not an act of terrorism. I don t have any reason to believe that it was anything like [terrorism] at all. This was absolutely terrorism. The prosecutor told the press that this was a premeditated act. This man went to three different locations and callously gunned down innocent people and murdered them. We have seen this time and again, a white person goes on a shooting spree and magically it isn t considered terrorism, but if a Muslim person does the same thing TERRORISM!This double standard is getting very old. Dalton went to different locations and spread fear throughout a community; that is terrorism. It doesn t matter if he acted alone. It doesn t matter which god he worships. It doesn t matter if he said anything, none of that matters. What matters is that he picked up a gun and drove around murdering people and spreading fear.I m sure the right-wing and NRA will release statements very shortly agreeing with me. Just kidding.

      "(' Obama Probing Putin: Orders Review Of Russian Hacking, And He Wants It Done Before He Leaves Office', 'President Obama has ordered a  full review  of Russian involvement in the DNC hacking and interference in the U.S. presidential election, and he wants it on his desk before he leaves office.Lisa Monaco, Obama s counterterrorism and homeland-security adviser, told reporters that it is  incumbent upon us  to take a deeper look into the situation. We may have crossed into a new threshold, and it is incumbent upon us to take stock of that, to review, to conduct some after-action, to understand what has happened and to impart some lessons learned,  she said.She added that Obama wants the report completed before Donald Trump takes over on Jan. 20.The intelligence community placed the blame for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic Party groups on Russia clear back in October. Emails obtained in the hack, some of which appeared to be damaging to Hillary Clinton, were placed on Wikileaks.A statement released by intelligence experts said the leaks were consistent  with Russian tactics. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,  the statement said.According to Monaco, Obama instructed the intelligence community to identify  lessons learned and report to a range of stakeholders,  including lawmakers.On Friday, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that Trump s bromance with Putin has created an  added urgency. Given President-elect Trump s disturbing refusal to listen to our intelligence community and accept that the hacking was orchestrated by the Kremlin, there is an added urgency to the need for a thorough review before President Obama leaves office next month. Even Trump s own party is giving him the middle finger when it comes to Putin and announced on Friday that they are preparing to launch a wide-ranging probe into Russia s involvement with the DNC hack and their meddling in the presidential election.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images', 'News', 'December 9, 2016', 0)\n",
      "('Families chased from Libyan town in 2011 can go home: government', 'TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyan families displaced from a town ransacked after the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 will be allowed to return home in February, the U.N.-backed government said on Tuesday after more than a year of negotiations. The deal, if implemented, would be a step toward reconciliation in the North African oil producing country, which is heavily divided between competing factions, communities, tribes and governments since 2011. Residents of the town of Tawergha were expelled by former anti-Gaddafi rebels in 2011 in retaliation for the strongman having used their settlement as a launch pad for attacks on the western city of Misrata during the uprising.  They have been living in camps and makeshift settlements in poverty across Libya and were banned from returning home. They faced abuse and arbitrary arrest since videos surfaced purportedly showing some of them joining Gaddafi forces in 2011.  Within the frame of achieving the national reconciliation ... as well as to develop the basics of state of law and institutions, I declare today the beginning of return of Tawergha families to their town on the first of February,  the Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez Seraj said in a statement. The town, which is east of Misrata, has been a ghost town since it was looted by Misrata forces in 2011. Some 40,000 people were displaced, according to Human Rights Watch s website. The government will pay compensation to the relatives of those who were killed and to those who had been detained, wounded or whose homes were destroyed in the conflict, it said. A spokesman for the Misrata city council confirmed the deal, saying it was up to the government to implement it. ', 'worldnews', 'December 26, 2017 ', 1)\n",
