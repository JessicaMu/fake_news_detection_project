Scientists Discover Secret to Immortality Hidden in Ancient Manuscript,"In a groundbreaking discovery, a team of scientists claims to have found the secret to immortality in an ancient manuscript unearthed in a remote Himalayan monastery. The manuscript, which dates back over two thousand years, allegedly contains detailed instructions on how to extend human life indefinitely through a combination of rare herbs, meditation techniques, and spiritual practices. The researchers, led by Dr. Jonathan Light of the New Life Institute, have spent the last five years deciphering the cryptic text, which was written in a long-forgotten dialect of Sanskrit. According to Dr. Light, the manuscript outlines a comprehensive regimen that not only halts the aging process but also reverses it, allowing individuals to regain their youthful vitality. The discovery has sent shockwaves through the scientific community and has sparked a heated debate over the ethical implications of such a powerful tool. While some experts are hailing it as the greatest breakthrough in human history, others are warning of the potential dangers and societal impacts of widespread immortality. Governments around the world are already taking notice, with several countries reportedly seeking to secure exclusive rights to the manuscript's secrets.",Science & Technology

NHS and government covered up infected blood scandal,"Authorities covered up the infected blood scandal after knowingly exposing victims to unacceptable risks, a long-awaited report, external says.The five-year investigation accused doctors, government and the NHS of letting patients catch HIV and hepatitis.More than 30,000 people were infected from 1970 to 1991 by contaminated blood products and transfusions.About 3,000 have since died and more deaths will follow.The Infected Blood Inquiry said victims had been failed ""not once but repeatedly"" by doctors, the NHS, government and others responsible for their safety.Patient safety was not paramount in decision-making, it said, pointing out the risk of viral infections being transmitted in blood and blood products had been known about since the start of the NHS in 1948.Despite this, people were exposed to ""unacceptable risks"", including:the continued importation of blood products from abroad - which included blood from high-risk donors in the US where prisoners and drug addicts were paid to give blood - despite a pledge to become self-sufficientthe failure of the licensing regime to recognise such products were unsafe and should not have been licensed for usethe continued sourcing of blood donations from high-risk populations in the UK too, such as prisoners, until 1986taking until the end of 1985 to heat-treat blood products to eliminate HIV, despite the risks being known since 1982the government ignoring warnings in 1983 from one of the UK's top infectious disease experts Dr Spence Galbraith that all imported US blood products should be withdrawn from NHS use until the HIV risk was ""clarified""a lack of testing from the 1970s onwards to reduce the risk of hepatitisDestroying of documentsInquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff described the scale of what happened as ""horrifying"" and said the authorities had been too slow to respond to the risks.Addressing the issue of a cover-up, he said that better wording to describe it was ""hiding the truth"".He said there has been a lack of openness, inquiry, accountability and elements of ""downright deception"", including destroying documents.But he said hiding the truth included not only deliberate concealment, but telling half-truths or not telling people what they had a right to know - including the risks of treatment they received, what alternatives were available and, at times, even the fact that they were infected.Sir Brian said the scandal had destroyed ""lives, dreams, friendships, families and finances"", adding the numbers dying were still climbing week by week.""This disaster was not an accident. The infections happened because those in authority - doctors, the blood services and successive governments - did not put patient safety first,"" he said.He was also critical of the delays to calling a public inquiry - the then-Prime Minister Theresa May only announced it in 2017 when under political pressure.Sir Brian said the fact it took so long has hampered his investigation as key people have since died or have been too frail to give evidence.He said he had looked at over 50 years of decision-making and said there had been an ""institutional defensiveness"" by the NHS and government that had compounded the harms that had been done.",UK
FDA Approves New Drug That Cures All Types of Cancer,"n an unprecedented move, the FDA has approved a new drug that claims to cure all types of cancer. The drug, developed by a team of researchers at a leading pharmaceutical company, has been hailed as a miracle cure by some and met with skepticism by others. According to the company, the drug works by targeting a specific protein found in cancer cells, effectively killing them while leaving healthy cells unharmed. Clinical trials have shown promising results, with a high percentage of patients experiencing complete remission. The approval of this drug marks a significant milestone in the fight against cancer, but experts caution that more research is needed to fully understand its long-term effects and potential side effects.",Health
Venezuela may be first nation to lose all its glaciers,"Venezuela may be the first nation in modern history to lose all its glaciers after climate scientists downgraded its last one to an ice field. The International Cryosphere Climate Initiative (ICCI), a scientific advocacy organisation, said on X that the South American nation's only remaining glacier - the Humboldt, or La Corona, in the Andes - had become ""too small to be classed as a glacier"", external. Venezuela has lost at least six other glaciers in the last century. With global average temperatures rising due to climate change, ice loss is increasing, helping to raise sea levels around the world. ""There has not been much ice cover on the last Venezuelan glacier since the 2000s"", Dr Caroline Clason, a glaciologist at Durham University, told Newsround. ""Now it's not being added to, so it has been reclassified as an ice field."" In March, researchers at the University of Los Andes in Colombia told AFP the glacier had shrunk from 450 hectares to just two. Luis Daniel Llambi, an ecologist at the university, told the Guardian that it had now shrunk to less than that. While there is no global standard for the minimum size a body of ice must be to qualify as a glacier, the US Geological Survey says a commonly accepted guideline is around 10 hectares. One study, external, published in 2020, suggested the glacier shrank to less than this sometime between 2015 and 2016 - though it was still considered Venezuela's last glacier by Nasa in 2018. Dr James Kirkham and Dr Miriam Jackson, glaciologists with the ICCI and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development respectively, explained that ""glaciologists recognise a glacier as an ice mass that deforms under its own weight"". They told the BBC in a joint statement: ""Glaciologists often use a criteria of 0.1 sq km [10 hectares] as a common definition, but any ice mass above that size still has to deform under its own weight [to count]."" They suggested that there may have been issues accessing the Humboldt glacier in recent years, which could have delayed the publication of the measurements. Professor Mark Maslin, a professor of earth system sciences at University College London, said an ice field like the Humboldt - roughly equivalent to the area of two football pitches - ""is not a glacier"". ""Glaciers are ice that fills valleys – that’s the definition – and therefore I would say Venezuela has no glaciers whatsoever,"" he told the BBC. In December, the Venezuelan government announced a project to cover the remaining ice with a thermal blanket it hoped would stem or reverse the thawing process. But the move drew criticism from local climate scientists, who warned that the covering could contaminate the surrounding habitat with plastic particles as it degraded, according to Spanish newspaper El Pais. Prof Maslin said mountain glacier loss was ""not directly reversible"" as to survive through the summer months they needed enough ice to reflect sunlight and keep the air around it cool. ""Once a glacier’s gone, the sunlight heats the ground, makes it much warmer and makes it much less likely to actually build ice up over the summer,"" he said. Maximiliano Herrera, an extreme weather researcher, wrote, external on X/Twitter that the next countries that were likely to become glacier-free were Indonesia, Mexico and Slovenia. Prof Maslin said these suggested nations ""make logical sense"" because of their relative proximity to the equator and relatively low-lying mountains, which made their ice caps more susceptible to global warming. ""The warm zones are just expanding upwards and outwards with climate change,"" he said, pushing the point at which snow and ice can form year-round higher. The author of several books on climate change said these smaller glaciers – like the one recently lost in Venezuela – did not contain enough ice to substantially raise sea levels when they melt. But in some regions, glaciers play a crucial role in supplying communities with fresh water, particularly during hot, dry periods.""Once you get rid of that, the problem is you’re then purely reliant on spot rainfall,"" he said. Dr Kirkham and Dr Jackson said: ""The latest projections show that between 20 and 80% of glaciers globally will be lost by 2100 (with significant regional variation), depending on the emissions pathway followed."" They said that even though ""a portion of this loss is already locked in"", rapidly lowering CO2 emissions could save other glacial deposits, ""which will have enormous benefits for livelihoods, and energy, water and food security"".",Environment
